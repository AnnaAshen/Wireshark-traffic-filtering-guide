# **Filter HTTP Traffic**
Wireshark offers two types of filters: **Capture Filters** to capture the selected traffic, and **Display Filters** to analyze the captured traffic.

## Capture Filters
Prior to capturing the packets, assign a filter to the selected interface using the following options:
- The *Capture filter* field in the welcome screen

- The **Capture** menu on the main toolbar

1. Select **Capture > Capture Options**.
2. In the filter line, enter the necessary filter. It will be assigned to the selected interface.

The available filters show in the **Capture filters** section. Here, you can add and remove them.

## Display Filters
**Display filters** apply after you stop capturing the traffic. The most commonly used filtering options are as follows:
- Enter `HTTP` to display only the packets using the HTTP protocol.

- Enter the protocol and port filter to display all the HTTP traffic, including handshake and termination TCP packets.

- Use `and` / `or` operators to make filters with multiple parameters. For example, if you need to filter the HTTP traffic exchanged with a specific IP address, enter the two parameters into the display filter line.

- Use `http.request.method` filter type to filter specific HTTP packets (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD, CONNECT, TRACE, etc.). For example, to filter only GET requests, enter this filter into the display filter line.

To trace the full HTTP stream, right-click on the HTTP packet and choose **Follow > HTTP Stream**. You will see a window with the full stream: request (in red) and response (in blue).
