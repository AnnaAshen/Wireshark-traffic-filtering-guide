## Setup
When you run Wireshark, in the welcome screen, you see the list of network connections (or interfaces) available for your device. Next to each interface name, you see the live traffic line chart. Choose the required interface by double-clicking on the corresponding interface name. Traffic capture will start automatically.

To start, stop, and restart traffic capture, choose the corresponding button on the toolbar.
